	Biography
</h1>
<p>
	I started my life as a small little seed full of big dreams. I was sold in a packet with my brothers and sisters. I remember the day my packet was opened. A very nice lady who owned a flower shop placed me in my very own pot where I flourished. She raised me well until I decided it was time to go on my own path. All my life the florist had these beautiful promotional posters and I couldn't ignore the designs. I didn't know such a job existed until one of her friends said that she wanted to become a graphic designer followed by a description of the job. I was in. I left my pot and family to go study in the big city. Currently going to Plantt U and majoring in graphic design.
